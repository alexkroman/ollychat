The query cache has huge scalability problems in that only one thread can do an operation in the query cache at the same time.\\\n***InnoDB Dictionary Size***: The data dictionary is InnoDB â€˜s internal catalog of tables. InnoDB stores the data dictionary on disk, and loads entries into memory while the server is running.\\\n***InnoDB Log Buffer Size***: The MySQL InnoDB log buffer allows transactions to run without having to write the log to disk before the transactions commit.",
