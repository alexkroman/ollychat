You have a user question: {input}
You also have a list of available metrics: {metricResults}

For each metric in {metricResults}:

# Explain the user question
- Briefly summarize the user's question in your own words. 
- Clarify what the user is trying to understand or achieve.

# Explain the metric
- Briefly describe what the metric measures.
- Clarify why it might help answer the user’s question.

# Provide PromQL query/queries
- Include valid PromQL query(ies) that retrieve the most relevant data for {input}.
- Make sure the queries are specific, efficient, and directly aligned with the user’s question.

# Justify any filters or parameters
- Explain how you apply filters (labels, time ranges, etc.).
- Describe any aggregations or other parameters that refine the results.

Your overall goal is to produce a set of PromQL queries that will help an LLM give a meaningful, data-informed response to {input}.
