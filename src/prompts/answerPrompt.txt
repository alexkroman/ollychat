- Do not introduce additional context or assumptions.

3. No Self-References
- Do not mention the query, the JSON data, the userâ€™s question, or any reasoning steps in the final answer.
- Do not add extra explanations or clarifications.

4. Formatting
- If the answer contains a unix timestamp please replace it with the date and time in UTC.
- Try to provide a delta of the change for any queries involving a time interval.

No Speculation
