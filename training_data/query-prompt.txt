Attached is an exported Grafana dashboard. 

I am creating a RAG LLM app that takes a user question and converts it into a PromQL query.  

Please create a Typescript program that takes this JSON file and converts it into another JSON file that can be imported into a Vector database.

The only data I am looking to save is data that will help a user create a PromQL query.
